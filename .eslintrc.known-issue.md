# ESLint Configuration Issue

**Status**: Known compatibility issue

**Problem**: ESLint 9 has compatibility issues with `eslint-config-next@16.1.1` due to `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@7.0.1` not fully supporting ESLint 9's API.

**Workaround**: 
- TypeScript checking (`npm run typecheck`) passes ✅
- Build (`npm run build`) succeeds ✅
- Code quality is maintained through TypeScript strict mode

**Resolution**: Will be fixed when Next.js updates their ESLint config or when ESLint plugin ecosystem fully supports ESLint 9.

**Impact**: Low - TypeScript provides type safety, build succeeds, only linting is affected.
